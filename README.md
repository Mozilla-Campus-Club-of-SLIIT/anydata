What can you do with this library?

- Load data in many formats from text or from a file (currently supports json, csv, xml, yaml)
- Convert data into any format (currently supports json, csv, xml, yaml)

## Installing

Ensure you have **Node.js** installed in your system (recommended Node.js v18 or higher).

```sh
# run the following command to install
$ npm install anydata
```

## Usage

```ts
import { csv, json, xml, yaml } from anydata

// load json from text
const data1 = json.from('{ "a": 1 }')
// load json from a file
const data2 = await json.loadFile("data.json")

// access data
data1.data

// convert data into other formats
data1.toYaml()
// export data as a file into other formats
await data1.exportYaml("export.yml")

```
